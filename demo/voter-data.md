## Your data - our responsibility
Almost every campaign consumes and processes copious amounts of voter data, but very few disclose where they store the data and what they do with it. Our campaign wants to be transparent with where we keep voter data and what we do with it. You can also learn about [how we secure your data](/election-security).

## About County Voter Data
One of the primary places we get voter data is from the County of San Mateo. Our campaign is very limited in our use of the data, but we do publish [which column headers we do use](https://files.sergioforsanmateo.com/data-transparency/county-voter-data/county-voter-file-column-headers.txt). _Our campaign will never publish protected voter data, nor will we ever sell, rent, or trade voter data._
